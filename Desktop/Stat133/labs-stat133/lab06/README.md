This lab is about understanding how to work with R script files. We go over the syntax of R script files, how commands are executed, and how they can be used to export data tables and text files using the command sink() and commands from the package 'readr'. We also make data visualizations with and without ggplot, then export these images. Then we work with 'dplyr' and introduce ourselves to piping in R.
